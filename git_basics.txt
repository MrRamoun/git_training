1)> Basic Termonlogy
====================
- commits: snapshots of --> structure of CWD & contents of files in a specific moment in time.
- repository: a timeline of commits and branches (A repository contains all project files, including the revision history).
- branches: new development paths that we can follow as long as we like without missing up original project.
- master branch: the main branch of the project.
- pull requests: a report of all changes made in a branch.
- cloning: downloading the repo from github to work-on (same repo == same id).
- pushing: uploading the repo to github.
- forking: copying the repository from one account on github to another (entirely new repo == not the same repo == different ids).

*Note: in order for pull requests on the same repo to work --> the admin must be cloning the repo (up to date) && the co-developer must push changes to remote repo (up to date)
